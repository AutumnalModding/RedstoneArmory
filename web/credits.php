				<font size="6">Redstone Armory Credits</font><br>
				No project is done with only one member, Redstone Armory is no exception, here's the cast of people to thank!<br><br>
				<b>The CoFH Team</b> for creating the mods that are required for us to do this.<br>
				<b>Tombenpotter</b> for constantly finding things I messed up and fixing them. Also for deciding to become a main member after I asked him &quot;Tom, why won't my pickaxe pickaxe?&quot;<br>
				<b>esKaayY</b> for forcing me to hurry this up for the next TPPI release. You can also thank him for the mess that is the 1.6 release.<br>
				<b>tterrag</b> for lots of help when I was lost.<br>
                <b>Professor29</b> for ideas and bug hunting.<br>
                <b>ChickenBones</b> for the some Vector thing that Tom uses for sucking items in. <br>
                <b>Vazkii</b> for making this site for Botania and making it open source. That's the only reason it's so pretty...<br>
              <b>+More</b> that I'm probably missing.<br>
