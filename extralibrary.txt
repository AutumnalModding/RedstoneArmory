From now on, we require trove4j-3.0.3.jar as an external library. Until I figure out how to package that with the dev environment, you're SOL
unless you have worked with the 1.7 CoFH workspace. If you have done that, the .jar, sources.jar, and javadoc.jar can be found in:

C:\Users\USER\.gradle\caches\modules-2\files-2.1\net.sf.trove4j\trove4j\3.0.3\

Link those and you should be good to go.
